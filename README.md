# fotoclicks
Fotoclicks is a Node.js web application built with Express, EJS, HTML5, CSS3, and MariaDB, providing a supportive community for photographers to upload and share their best shots

The application offers a range of features, including user authentication, image uploads, and commenting. The site is designed to provide a supportive community where photographers can interact with each other and get inspired by beautiful photos from around the world.

Future enhancements to the fotoclicks platform include gallery creation, likes, upvotes, and search functionality. With these features, photographers will be able to organize and share their work more easily, while users can search and discover images based on their interests. The goal of the project is to showcase how modern web development technologies like Node.js, can be used to create a robust and scalable web application quickly and easily.
