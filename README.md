# fotoclick
Fotoclick is a photo-sharing platform that allows photographers to upload and share their best shots with others. This is a Node.js web application built with Express, EJS, HTML5, CSS3, and MariaDB.

The application offers a range of features, including user registration, authentication, image uploads, commenting, upvoting and downvoting of comments. The site is designed to provide a supportive community where photographers can interact with each other and get inspired by beautiful photos from around the world.

Future enhancements to the fotoclicks platform include personal gallery creation, reactions, and search functionality. With these features, photographers will be able to organize and share their work more easily, while users can search and discover images based on their interests. This project showcases how modern web development technologies like Node.js, can be used to create a robust and scalable web application quickly and easily.
